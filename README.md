## Credits: Or Esperansa

## Instructions

- Press P to cycle to the next algorithm
- Press N to cycle to the next heuristic function (if available)
- Press W to change to weight mode
- Press C to clear walls and weights
- Use left mouse button to place start and end point
- After start and end point are placed, click left click to place walls
- Use right click to remove unwanted cells and to adjust the field
- Press space to start the simulation

## Colors meaning

- Blue - Start/end point
- Black - Wall
- Green - Open set (nodes to be visited)
- Red - Closed set (nodes that have already been visited)
- Pink - Solution/Path

## Algorithms included:
- A*
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- BFS
- Greedy BFS (Best first search) 
- DFS

## Coming Soon 
- Heuristic Manager ✔
